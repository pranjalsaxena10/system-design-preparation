Here we have one Duck class having 3 methods as quack(), swim() and display()

- display() -> abstract method
- MallardDuck and RedHeadDuck are type of Ducks
- They have own implementation of display method, since each subtype of duck would look different.
- New requirement arrives.
- fly() functionality needs to be added

# Problem
### How and where fly() functionality should be added?
